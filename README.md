# Newspaper App

This project involved the design of a database comprising three tables with a many-to-many relationship. I developed a REST API to facilitate operations such as data insertion, modification, deletion, and updating within the database. Opting for the React framework on the front end, I aimed to enhance my front-end development skills. The implementation included features that utilized HTTP requests to the backend API, allowing the addition of data to the database through purpose-built forms and tables. 

# Purpose of the project

## The main goal was to learn how to create an application to manage a database

1. Learned how to design a database structure with multiple tables and establish relationships, particularly a many-to-many relationship.
2. Gained experience in building a RESTful API to interact with the database. This included creating endpoints for handling various operations like data insertion, modification, deletion, and retrieval.
3. Enhanced my skills in backend development, working with technologies like Express.js and MySQL to implement server-side logic and database interactions.
4. Developed proficiency in using React for building responsive and dynamic user interfaces. This included creating forms, tables, and components to interact with the backend API.
5. Learned how to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API

# How to use the project (Node JS should be installed on your computer)

1. Import the database in MySQL.
2. Change the host, user, password and database in the /server/database/database.js with your own.
3. To run the React App go to client folder in terminal and type "npm start".
4. To run the server go to server folder in another terminal and type "npm start".
5. Feel free to change the project for your own needs!
